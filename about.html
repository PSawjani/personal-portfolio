            <small>I worked as a web developer intern for 6 months. I used Magento e-commerce to help build websites for clients and I also did data-entry work to help record specific information.</small>
            <p>2021-2024 - Junior Web Developer at airduka.com in Nairobi, Kenya</p>
            <small>I worked as a junior web developer for 3 years and 3 months. My main role was to convert designs made by the graphic designer dept. to web pages. Occassionally, I would also get the chance to help the backend developers to make web pages dynamic and retrieve relevant information from the database. We used Laravel PHP Framework on the Backend and Vue JS for the Frontend.</small>
